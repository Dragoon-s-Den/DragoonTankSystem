# Dragoon Tank System
  DTS is a modular weapon system designed to provide the most varied combat capabilities in a single package.
Its modular architecture allows the user to assign any number of weapons to any number of seats, at any combination
desired, everything under a single vehicle.
  This system has been designed for an half arcade half realistic style, as it combines an elegantly simple
user interface with simple controls.

## FAQ
- **What's the price?**
  Dragoon Tank System is FREE, as are all DD products.
- **Will it require spearhead?**
  DTS does not require a full spearhead installation to run. However, we strongly recommend using spearhead for
  the best experience and compatibility.
